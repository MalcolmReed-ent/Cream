Background information
----------------------

 What cream is and what it's not

  cream does what I need. It won't do other things. I'm open for pull
  requests but please don't be upset if I turn them down -- which might
  happen if it's a feature that I simply don't need. That being said,
  you should have a look at the PATCHES file. :-)

  cream does not compete with powerful browsers like vimb or luakit, 
  nor with monstrous applications like Qutebrowser or Firefox or 
  Chromium. cream won't have persistent storage, nor a plugin system, 
  nor cloud sync, nor bookmarks.


 About the name

  "Cream: The Smoothness and Richness of a Browser" 

  I selected the name because I am a huge admirer of the rock
  supergroup CREAM (1966-1969), featuring Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce, and 
  Ginger Baker. I picked this band because they are a supergroup, with
  each member being a standout talent alongside two other legends. Thus 
  them being the "Cream of The Crop" 
  
  This browser showcases three features, which are...
  1. Smooth - Effortless as Clapton's riff and smooth as Bruce's bass
  2. Simplicity – Sleek and compact outwardly, yet a powerhouse beneath.
  3. Speed – Fast, it keeps you "So Glad" while you can truly "Feel Free".
