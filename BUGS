Links sometimes do not open in a new tab
========================================

We select for "mouse-target-changed" events: When the pointer is being
moved, WebKit tells us if it's now being positioned over a link or not.

However, when a new link pops into existence right below the mouse
pointer (without the pointer being moved), we don't get this event. When
the user now issues a middle-click, we open the link in the same tab.
This is wrong.

Ideally, we could access a hit test result while processing the click
event, but that doesn't appear to be possible?

This bug is also present in suckless surf and GNOME Epiphany.


Features To Add List
====================

Adblocking support built in


Javascript heavy sites dont load, possibly webkit2gtk 
=====================================================
				
Delays occur on more javascript sites which needs a refresh to load correctly or it will hang in loading, not because of internet connection/speed or hardware


Improvements List
=================

Make hinting faster on more longer/bloated sites
